The information from the social networks is about the client's features, interests, likes/dislikes, events/things, heard/liked music, artists, profession, knowledge, places he/she visited, played games, persons he/she knows and interacts with.</p>

                                <p>The FOAF graph will be constructed based on information from Facebook. The user must be connected to Facebook in order to create the graph and then be provided with the random or requested recommendations. </p>
                                <h2 id="chapter8">8.  FOAF graph</h2>
                                <p>FOAF graph (friend of a friend) is a RDF file that stores personal information taken from a social network (Facebook). </p>
                                <p>Personal information means information from Facebook profile, including client's friends,  likes, events, things, professions, music, artists, work places, educational institutes, domains of work and study, stores, electronics, clothes and so on.</p>

                                <p>A FOAF graph is created first when the client connects to a social network, in a RDF format (.xml/.ttl). The client has the possibility to update the content of the graph every time he/she requests so. 	 </p>
                                <p>Note:  Time limit of updating the graph can be changed if necessary.</p>

                                <p>FOAF graph will be loaded on the server side every time it is created/updated. There will be a RDF graph or more for each user that has an account for this application.</p>
                                <h3 id="chapter8p3">8.3 Usage of FOAF graph</h3>
                                <p> The graph is used for:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>random generated recommendations  displayed on homepage</li>
                                    <li>on user request generated recommendations.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h2 id="chapter9">9. API specifications </h2>
                                <p>RAML file is used to describe API specifications</p>
                                <h3 id="chapter9p1">9.1 RAML file</h3>
                                <p> RAML file describes the API specifications of the application. The API is structured in four main modules:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><span class="strong">Randomly generated recommandations</span><br>
                                        Based on users’s FOAF graph, the app will first extract similarities – most common occurrences of things (places, movies), most popular events. It will also take into account user’s geographical location and current town as listed on Facebook. Considering this data, it will search for events nearby, similar movies, people who went to the same school and other things. Finally, the user will see query results filtered by type on his home page, or he can request the list by calling the following endpoints: /recommendations?item_type=[TYPE_OF_ITEM], where TYPE_OF_ITEM is one of: person, event, movie, book, place, educational_institute. A drop-down with the five classes of recommendations will be available, serving as a filter where the client can chose the type of recommendations to see.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><span class="strong">Graph content</span><br>
                                        The user can see the content of his generated FOAF graph, sorted by relevance and filterd by item type, by calling the following uri: <code>/graph?item_type= [TYPE_OF_ITEM]</code>, where TYPE_OF_ITEM is one of: person, event, movie, book, place, educational_institute.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><span class="strong">Search module</span><br>
                                        The user will be able to look for stuff by defining his own criteria in five different forms for each type of resource.  Some examples – the client wants to get all books of Agatha Christie first published after 1940; the client wants to get all universities with over 5000 students and at least 2 Nobel Prize laureates.<br>
                                        All search features will be available by querying the following endpoint:
		<code>/search/[TYPE_OF_ITEM]</code>, with TYPE_OF_ITEM one of: person, event, movie, book, place, educational_institute.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><span class="strong">Saved items</span><br>
                                        >The user will have the possibility to give positive/negative feedback for each query result, by clicking like/disliked. The item specified will be stored into database. Disliked items will not be taken into account on the next query (or, from the client point of view, on the next set of recommendations, either random or custom). Saved items can be filtered by type or grouped into user-defined lists with suggestive names. An items can be on many lists or on none. For reasons of time and space complexity, only at most three-months old saved items will be considered on queries.<br>
                                        By calling the endpoint  <code>/saved-items?item_type=[TYPE_OF_ITEM]</code>,  the user will get the list of all items. For lists, a call to /lists/[list_id] is required.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p> Queries send by the user are saved on server side, in our database. This way, they will be available to the client from any computer, anytime.</p>
                                <h2 id="chapter12">12. User preferences</h2>
                                <p>A list of preferences will be saved for the user profile when he/she indicates the results liked by the user.</p>		
                                <p>Beside this list, SOR also creates a blacklist of results that should not be included in the displayed results. In this way SOR becomes more accurate each time it is used.</p>
                                <p>Two checks will be available for each result one with ‘+’ meaning to include this result in the user profile, and one with ’–‘, meaning to exclude this result when receiving a recommendation.</p>		
                                <p>Preferences are by default kept from the first time the user signed in his account, but there is a checklist available where the user can select the period of time the preferences were added.</p>
